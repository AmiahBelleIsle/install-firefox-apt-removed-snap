# Install Firefox after removing snaps

A shell script that installs Firefox after removing snaps. Typically, you will get a dependency error when doing "sudo apt install firefox" after removing snaps.
The process of installing Firefox after removing snaps is tedious considering that removing snaps also removes the Firefox you already had installed, hence this script to automate the process.
