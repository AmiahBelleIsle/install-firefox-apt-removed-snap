This shell script installs Firefox on Debian based systems using apt. It automatically imports the Mozilla signing key and pins the .deb version, which should resolve dependency errors that may happen otherwise.

This script is particularly useful if you wish to use the regular Firefox and not Firefox ESR on your Debian system, or if you are using Ubuntu and want to install Firefox without using snaps.
